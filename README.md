# LNM AND OS PREDICTION


## Overview
This repository contains Python scripts for running a machine-learning model to predict LNM (Lymph Node Metastasis) and OS (Overall Survival) using Mamba techniques (Mamba is a deep-learning architecture focused on sequence modeling). The model is designed to be executed on a system with GPU support for accelerated computation.

## Requirements
- **Operating System:** Ubuntu 22.04 LTS
- **Python Version:** Python 3.8
- **CUDA:** Required for GPU computation

## Installation

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/qbingjiang/GC_NandOS_prediction.git
   cd GC_NandOS_prediction
